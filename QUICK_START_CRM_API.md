# üöÄ CRM API - Quick Start Guide

## Step 1: Generate Token (2 minutes)

```bash
php artisan crm:generate-token admin@example.com
```

**Save the token!** You'll need it for all API calls.

## Step 2: Test It Works (1 minute)

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token from Step 1:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost/api/crm/appointments?per_page=5" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" ^
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

‚úÖ If you see JSON data with appointments, it's working!

## Step 3: Choose Your Integration

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost/api/crm/appointments/recent?minutes=30" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" ^
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Option B: Export as CSV

Download all appointments as CSV file:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost/api/crm/appointments/export" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" ^
